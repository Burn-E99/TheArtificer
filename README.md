The Artificer is a Discord bot that specializes in rolling dice.  The bot utilizes the compact [Roll20 formatting](https://artificer.eanm.dev/roll20) for ease of use and will correctly perform any needed math on the roll (limited to basic algebra).

This bot was developed to replace the Sidekick discord bot after it went offline many times for extended periods, and is now dead according to their GitHub.  This was also developed to fix some annoyances that were found with Sidekick, specifically its vague error messages (such as `"Tarantallegra!"`, what is that supposed to mean) and its inability to handle implicit multiplication (such as `4(12 + 20)`).

## Using The Artificer
I am hosting this bot for public use and you may find its invite link below.  If you would like to host this bot yourself, details of how to do so are located [here](https://github.com/Burn-E99/TheArtificer/blob/master/docs/SELF_HOSTING.md), but I do not recommend this unless you are experienced with running Discord bots.

After inviting the bot, if you would like it to remove the message requesting the popcat emoji, you will need to give the `The Artificer` role the `Manage Messages` permission.  All other permissions needed are handled by the invite link.
